                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Our journey began when our founder, Dalton Smith, realized the difficulties faced by small business owners in promoting their businesses effectively. The idea of creating a web app that combines business listings with a seamless reservation system was born out of a passion for empowering entrepreneurs and creating a win-win solution for both businesses and customers.</p>
